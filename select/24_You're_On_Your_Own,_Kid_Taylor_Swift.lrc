[00:00.36] Summer went away
[00:02.46] Still, the yearning stays
[00:04.46] I play it cool with the best of them
[00:08.56] I wait patiently
[00:10.27] He's gonna notice me
[00:12.93] It's okay, we're the best of friends
[00:17.10] Anyway
[00:20.10] 
[00:20.43] I hear it in your voice
[00:22.15] You're smoking with your boys
[00:24.55] I touch my phone as if it's your face
[00:28.29] I didn't choose this town
[00:30.33] I dream of getting out
[00:32.72] There's just one who could make me stay
[00:37.95] All my days
[00:43.45] 
[00:40.61] From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
[00:44.59] I waited ages to see you there
[00:48.68] I search the party of better bodies
[00:52.72] Just to learn that you never cared
[01:09.72] 
[00:57.34] You're on your own, kid
[00:58.92] You always have been
[01:08.92] 
[01:04.11] I see the great escape
[01:06.39] So long, Daisy May
[01:08.51] I picked the petals, he loves me not
[01:12.44] Something different bloomed
[01:14.58] Writing in my room
[01:16.65] I play my songs in the parking lot
[01:21.72] I'll run away
[01:28.22] 
[01:24.42] From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
[01:28.48] I called a taxi to take me there
[01:32.59] I search the party of better bodies
[01:36.60] Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
[01:56.60] 
[01:41.34] You're on your own, kid
[01:42.96] You always have been
[01:52.96] 
[02:04.37] From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
[02:08.49] I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
[02:12.53] I hosted parties and starved my body
[02:16.69] Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
[02:34.19] 
[02:20.49] The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
[02:24.66] My friends from home don't know what to say
[02:28.53] I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
[02:32.43] And I saw something they can't take away
[02:52.43] 
[02:36.35] 'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
[02:40.48] Everything you lose is a step you take
[02:44.26] So make the friendship bracelets
[02:46.59] Take the moment and taste it
[02:48.59] You've got no reason to be afraid
[03:05.09] 
[02:53.24] You're on your own, kid
[02:57.46] Yeah, you can face this
[03:01.40] You're on your own, kid
[03:02.88] You always have been
