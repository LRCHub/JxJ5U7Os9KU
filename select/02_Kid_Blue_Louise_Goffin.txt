Kid Blue, speak up now or forever hold your peace
Stand up tall or fall down on your knees
'Cause the battles never cease
You're outrageous
Even in the eyes of Hollywood
Keep them laughing
'Cause they know you're only passing through, Kid Blue

Kid Blue, madness is your mattress
Fear your right hand man
But when we leave you alone, I hope you'll understand
'Cause we are far from your fingertips
And we can't read your mind
We are deaf to your pleas and cries
We are deaf and you are blind, Kid Blue
I know you, Kid Blue
